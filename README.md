# Code_Samples
3 Code samples required for an Unreal Engine Programmer Intern application. 2 made with UE4, 1 made with Unity.
Here is a link to a Github repo containing these files too: https://github.com/JamesR48/Code_Samples

* The "PDFs" folder contains the 3 classes in PDF format. The UE4 PDFs have both the .h and .cpp classes inside.
*  The "Source" folder contains 2 sub-folders: one called "UE4" which contains the .h and .cpp source files of two different classes. And one called "Unity" which contains a class's .cs source file.
