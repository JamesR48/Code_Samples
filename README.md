# Code_Samples
3 Code samples required for an Unreal Engine Programmer Intern application. 2 made with UE4, 1 made with Unity.
Here is a link to a Github repo containing these files too: https://github.com/JamesR48/Code_Samples

* The "PDFs" folder contains the 3 classes in PDF format. The UE4 PDFs have both the .h and .cpp classes inside.
*  The "Source" folder contains 2 sub-folders: one called "UE4" which contains the .h and .cpp source files of two different classes. And one called "Unity" which contains a class's .cs source file.

Here is a link to my Game Dev demo reel where you can see the prototypes where this classes are used: https://shorturl.at/cjtuN
The Unity source is from the 2nd game presented in the video (a Beat em' Up called "Como Fua"), and the UE4 sources are from the 3rd game (a shooting/driving game called "Crazy Tank")
